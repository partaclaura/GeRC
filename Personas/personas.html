                    her daughter.
                    <p>She also has to monitor the state in which some devices are while she is at work or on a business trip in order to be less worried about

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Alex is a university student who is currently pursuing a degree in computer science. 
                    He was born with a visual impairment. Due to this disability, he often finds it difficult to get used to new places.</p>
                <p>Considering that he is in his first year of university, he had to move to Iasi with his brother, who already lived there.
                    He is still struggling to get used to the new apartment.
                    Even though his brother has some smart devices, Alex is still struggling to figure out where they are positioned. Also, some of these
                    devices don't offer support for visually impaired individuals.
                </p>
                <p>Alex would like to be able to easily interact with these devices, despite their positioning and accessibility, in order to become more
                    independent and also save time in order to properly focus on his studies. He considers that it would be ideal for him to be able to
                    use vocal commands on his phone in order to interact with smart devices and also pick custom gestures to control those devices.</p>

				<p>Sara is an 11-year-old primary school student. Due to her parents jobs, she often finds herself home alone.</p>
                <p>She is trying to show her parents that she is becoming more responsible and asks them to create a child account so she can
                   be able to control certain devices, with restrictions applied by them. She considers that if she can add some easier-to-learn 
                   gestures to device settings, she can better understand how they work and also save her parents time and concerns.</p>
